"""
Summer camp management system implementation complete!

Model updates:
✅ Role-based User model (Student, Mentor, Admin, Cafe Assistant)
✅ Dorm capacity validation (4 students per dorm)
✅ Many-to-many relationships (students ↔ departments, mentors ↔ departments)
✅ Meal attendance tracking with constraints (1 meal per type per day)
✅ Database-level uniqueness constraint for meal records
✅ Four technical departments seeded

Key features for concurrent cafe management:
- Multiple cafe assistants can register meals simultaneously
- Database constraint prevents duplicate meal entries
- API validation ensures meal type is provided for meal attendance
- Recorded_by field tracks which cafe assistant registered each meal

API endpoints updated:
- /api/departments/ - Technical departments (Embedded & Robotics, Cyber Security, Aerospace, Development)
- /api/students/ - Students with dorm assignments and departments
- /api/mentors/ - Mentors who can manage multiple departments
- /api/attendance/ - Meal and activity attendance with validation

To test meal registration:
1. Create a student via admin or API
2. POST to /api/attendance/ with:
   {
     "student_id": <student_id>,
     "date": "2025-08-17",
     "attendance_type": "MEAL",
     "meal_type": "BREAKFAST",
     "notes": "Optional notes"
   }
3. Try to register the same meal again - should fail with validation error

Next steps you might want:
- Cafe assistant UI for quick meal check-ins by student ID
- Reports for meal attendance and department participation
- Mobile app for mentors to track psychological/physical activities
- Dashboard for admins to view occupancy and attendance stats
