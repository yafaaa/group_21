Http versions
HTTP has evolved through several versions, each designed to improve performance, security, and efficiency.
HTTP/0.9 (1991) – Very basic, only supported GET requests, no headers, plain text responses.

HTTP/1.0 (1996) – Added headers, status codes, support for different media types, but required a new TCP connection for each request.

HTTP/1.1 (1997) – Persistent connections (keep-alive), chunked transfers, caching improvements, still widely used today.

HTTP/2 (2015) – Multiplexing (multiple requests in one connection), header compression, binary protocol, faster loading.

HTTP/3 (2022) – Uses QUIC (over UDP), reduces latency, improves security, especially for mobile and high-latency networks.
